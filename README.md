# BashChat
BashChat is a simple but elegant chat room application that can be run within bash.
## Before you start hacking
I have added detailed descriptions at the beginning of server.py and client.py. Please take a minute to read each of them before you start hacking away.
## Usage
Simply run 'server.py' and then 'client.py'
